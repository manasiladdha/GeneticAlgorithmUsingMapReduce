# GeneticAlgoritmUsingMapReduce

The genetic algorithm program was designed to generate an expression which will represent a target number. Each digit and operator in the expression is represented in 4-bits and the series of bits form a chromosome. The program randomly generates an expression and performs the genetic transformations i.e. selection, crossover and mutation, to produce a chromosome with good fitness score. The solution chromosome is a valid chromosome where number is followed by an operator and the fitness score is 1, i.e. it the equivalent to the target number.
